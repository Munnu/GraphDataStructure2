This was a homework assignment.

This program is a simple graph data structure program, similar to the other graph program I have on git.

The user is allowed to load a file, in this case the .txt file provided mentions a number of different cities and their distances from each other. The cities are noted as nodes, while the milages are edges. Once the file is loaded, the user can add or remove a node or edge. The user could do a breadth-first traversal to see if all of the nodes are connected to each other, and print the tree. This is all text-based.

To explain the text file
n = node
e = edge
Cities are the 2nd to left-most thing there. 
The numbers after the milage are the numbers connecting the nodes.
For instance, 2800 1 2 is the milage between the first and second nodes: NY and LA.
2 and 3 would be the milage between LA and Chicago.
